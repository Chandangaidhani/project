    <h1 style="color: tomato;">History</h1>
    <p style="color: lightskyblue;"> The site is the former location of the Babri Masjid, which was built in the 16th century. The idols of Rama and
        Sita were placed in the mosque in 1949, before the mosque was attacked and demolished in 1992. In
        2019, the Supreme Court of India delivered the verdict to give the disputed land to Hindus for the construction
        of a temple, while Muslims would be given land elsewhere to construct a mosque.<br> The court referenced a
        report from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as evidence suggesting the presence of a structure beneath
        the demolished Babri Masjid, that was found to be non-Islamic. The ASI claims were heavily disputed by
        critics as contradictory and unreliable, but after detailed proceedings, the Supreme Court
        accepted the ASI report as valid. The Supreme Court in its landmark judgement concluded that the underlying
        structure beneath the mosque was not an Islamic structure. However, the court concluded that no evidence was
        found that a non-Islamic structure was specifically demolished for the construction of the Babri Masjid.</p>
    <h2 style="color: blue;">Bhumi pujan</h2>
    <p style="color: cadetblue;">The temple construction officially started again after a Bhumi-Pujan (transl.ground breaking ceremony) on 5
        August 2020. The three-day long Vedic ritual was held ahead of the groundbreaking ceremony, which revolved
        around the installation of a 40 kg (88 pounds) silver brick as the foundation stone by Prime Minister Narendra
        Modi. On the day before on 4 August, the Ramarchan Puja (transl.Puja of Rama's feet) was performed, in order
        to ritually invite all the major deities into the temple.</p>
